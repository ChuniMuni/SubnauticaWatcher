## Todo

Lots of stuff!

### Short Term

* ~~Extracted data is misnamed (y/z axes swapped), needs to be fixed.~~
* Migrate data extraction into source control
* ~~Improve data quality~~
* ~~Create biome map with aurora/island outline~~
* ~~Ability to turn makers on/off~~

### Longer Term

* Allow custom markers (e.g. beacons)
* Allow player position calculation from 3 beacon distances (2D)
* ~~Overground / Underground maps/layers (e.g. lava zone)~~
