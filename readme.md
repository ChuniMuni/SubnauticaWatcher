# SubnauticaWatcher Mod

## Purpose

This mod adds a "live" map to the Subnautica game. This can be considered a spoiler for the game.

Should the Subnautica development team ever add an auto-map or ingame map feature, this mod will be obsoleted.

## Capabilities

* Shows current player position
* Shows lifepod position
* Shows all beacons/pings available to player.

__Caveats:__ Background images and additional overlay data taken from Wiki and may be out-of-date.

## Installation

__Warning:__ While attempts have been made to ensure this mod does not interfere with other mods, this cannot
be guaranteed.

1. Download the latest Release zip
2. Extract the zip into your Subnautica installation folder, (usually `Steam\steamapps\common\Subnautica`)
3. Unless updating, or unless you have another mod installed it should not normally require overwriting of anything.
4. In your `Steam\steamapps\common\Subnautica\Managed\Data` folder run `SubnauticaWatcherInstaller.exe`
5. Click the "Install" button.
6. Check for errors, then exit `SubnauticaWatcherInstaller.exe`.

__Warning:__ You may need to repeat steps 4 to 6 whenever Steam updates Subnautica.

2. Open Steam Overlay (usually by pressing "shift-tab")
