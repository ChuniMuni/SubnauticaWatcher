## Purpose

This mod adds a "live" map to the [Subnautica][2] game. This can be considered a spoiler for the game.

Should the Subnautica development team ever add an auto-map or ingame map feature, this mod will be obsoleted.

## Motivation

I tend to get lost a lot in Subnautica. Exploring is great fun, but once I've found something, once I know where something is, I really want to be able to find it again. Beacons help a great deal, but for some things, like resources, when I don't have a beacon available or when I simply want to know which way to turn to get to a biome a map is invaluable.

If I were really trapped on 4546B I'd definitely be drawing a map, pinning it to wall in my cyclops, or drawing it in AlterraPaint on my PDA.

This mod is my personal answer to not having an in-game map. I'm making it available as I'm sure there must be at least one other person that would like an in-game (ish) map.

## Capabilities

* Works in a web-browser (chrome), and hence in Steam Overlay.
* Displays the current player position (icon, coords) and current biome
* Displays all ping manager items on the map (beacons, signals, vessels)
* Has multiple background layers (blank, biomes(default), lost river, etc).
* Has a store of POIs, taken from the wiki, (off by default), for things like wrecks, degasi bases, vents etc. (very much spoilers, also probably out-of-date).
* v0.4 - Day / Night indicator
* v0.5 - Leviathan Spawns now in their own layer.
* v0.6 - Now able to automatically switch to correct base layer (e.g. Lost River, Lava Zone)
* v0.7 - Installer now handles cases where Subnautica is not in the default Steam library.

## Installation

__Warning:__ While attempts have been made to ensure this mod does not interfere with other mods, this cannot
be guaranteed.

__Warning:__ Only works on __Experimental__ branch.

__Warning:__ You may need to repeat steps 4 to 6 whenever Steam updates Subnautica.

1. Download the latest Release zip
2. Extract the zip into your Subnautica installation folder, (usually `Steam\steamapps\common\Subnautica`)
3. Unless updating, or unless you have another mod installed it should not normally require overwriting of anything.
4. In your `Steam\steamapps\common\Subnautica\SubnauticaWatcherInstaller` folder run `SubnauticaWatcherInstaller.exe`
5. Click the "Install" button.
6. Check for errors, then exit `SubnauticaWatcherInstaller.exe`.

## Usage

1. Run Subnautica as usual
2. Open Steam Overlay (usually by pressing "shift-tab")
3. Select "Web Browser"
4. Enter the URL: http://localhost:63030

## Troubleshooting

### Untrusted Publisher / Application

If you receive this warning from Windows, it's because this application isn't signed.

If you decide you want to trust this program, or you've read the source code and assured yourself it's benign, then you can [run the program anyway][1].

### Logs

As of version 0.3.0 the installer creates logs to help with error reporting and resolving issues.

You can find the logs in `Steam\steamapps\common\Subnautica\SubnauticaWatcherInstaller\Logs\{date}.log`

### Restore Subnautica to pristine state

1. Delete folder `Steam\steamapps\common\Subnautica\Subnautica_Data\Managed`
2. This will remove not only this mod, but every single other mod/tools/change you've made to this folder.
3. Open Steam
4. Find Saubnautica in your games list
5. Right-click and Select 'Properties'
6. On the 'Local Files' tab click on 'Verify Integrity of Game Files...'

This will cause steam to re-download all files that might have been changed by this mod, or other programs/mods.
